# Bigtop smoke test template
#
# This provides basic Bigtop smoke test capabilities. This should be modified
# as needed for individual charms. Specifically, you should determine what
# outcome is considered "succesful" and what warrants a "failure", and set
# the action outcome/output as appropriate.
